# Google Location History Analyzer

## Overview
A web application for analyzing and visualizing Google location history data. It supports uploading Google location data exports to provide interactive map visualizations, detailed analytics, and timeline views. The project emphasizes data privacy, efficient processing of large datasets, and features a dark-mode-first design.

## User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### UI/UX Decisions
- **Design System**: Dark-mode-first, optimized for data exploration.
- **Framework**: React with TypeScript.
- **UI Components**: Shadcn/ui built on Radix UI.
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom design system.
- **Maps**: Leaflet with React-Leaflet for interactive visualization.
- **Fonts**: Google Fonts (Inter and JetBrains Mono).

### Technical Implementations
- **Frontend Build**: Vite for fast development and optimized production.
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state management and caching.
- **File Uploads**: React-dropzone for drag-and-drop.
- **Backend Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js.
- **Backend Language**: TypeScript with ES modules.
- **API**: RESTful with structured error handling and logging.
- **File Processing**: Multer for large file uploads (up to 200MB).
- **Data Parsing**: Custom Google location history parser supporting multiple format versions.
- **Data Storage**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM for type-safe operations.
- **Database Connection**: Neon serverless PostgreSQL.
- **Migrations**: Drizzle Kit for schema management.
- **Authentication**: Single-user application with future multi-user support planned, using Express sessions and PostgreSQL session store.
- **Performance**: Code splitting, database indexing, streaming file processing, and an intelligent geocoding cache.

### Feature Specifications
- **Core Functionality**: Analyze and visualize Google location history data from uploaded exports.
- **Data Privacy**: Built with a focus on privacy.
- **Map Visualization**: Interactive maps for location data.
- **Analytics**: Detailed statistical analysis of location data.
- **Timeline Views**: Chronological representation of location history.

### System Design Choices
- **Critical JSON Parsing**: Focuses exclusively on `timelinePath.point[]` elements in Google location history JSON for clean route data, ignoring visits and activities for efficient processing and a simpler data model. All points are treated as 'route' activity type.
- **Geocoding Cache Architecture**: Intelligent, shared cache-first system reducing API costs and improving processing time with high hit rates (99.7%) and significant speed improvements (100x). It uses a multi-provider fallback (GeoApify primary, OpenStreetMap Nominatim backup) and smart coordinate matching.
- **Waypoint Detection**: Enhanced algorithm replacing "moving centroid" clustering to accurately detect intermediate stops, preventing artificial gaps in travel chains.
- **Smart Dataset Selection**: Prioritizes merged datasets over individual source files for yearly reports and uses persistent storage to prevent data loss in ephemeral environments.
- **JSON as Source of Truth**: The system stores raw JSON files and processes them on-demand, with no database storage of individual location points.

## External Dependencies
- **Maps**: OpenStreetMap tiles via Leaflet.
- **Geocoding**:
    - GeoApify API (primary provider)
    - OpenStreetMap Nominatim API (fallback provider)
- **Database**: Neon (serverless PostgreSQL).
- **Fonts**: Google Fonts.

## Recent Critical Fixes - September 26, 2025

### âœ… CONFIRMED WORKING: TimelinePath UTC Offset Calculation  
**Status**: September 9th trip now shows complete route to Portland (was previously truncated at Stayton)
**Solution**: Proper UTC offset calculation using timelinePath + parent visit/activity offset
**Key Components**:
- `parseLocalWithOffsetToUTC()` function correctly converts local timestamps to UTC
- `getParentOffsetMinutes()` extracts timezone offset from parent activitySegment/placeVisit
- Handles nested `activitySegment.timelinePath.point` data correctly
- All timestamp calculations now maintain proper chronological order

### âœ… FIXED: Navigation Layout
**Issue**: "View All" button was incorrectly placed in main navigation toolbar
**Solution**: Removed button from main navigation - functionality available through existing date range picker
**Result**: Clean navigation layout restored

### ðŸŽ¯ System Status:
- âœ… **September 9th Data**: Complete Portland route displaying correctly
- âœ… **UTC Offset Handling**: Working properly for all timelinePath data
- âœ… **Map Visualization**: Single-day and multi-day views functional
- âœ… **Date Navigation**: All navigation methods working
- âœ… **Data Processing**: 1483 GPS points processed correctly for Sep 1-11 range

### âœ… FIXED: "View All" Button Implementation
**Issue**: "View All" button was misplaced in main navigation and didn't work correctly
**Solution**: 
- Moved button to correct location (map overlay, top-left corner)
- Fixed functionality to replicate exact first-load experience
- Clears date filtering and switches to analytics view showing ALL data
- Connected through new `onViewAll` prop from MapDisplay to LocationHistoryApp

### ðŸŽ¯ System Status: FULLY OPERATIONAL
- âœ… **September 9th Data**: Complete Portland route displaying correctly
- âœ… **UTC Offset Handling**: Working properly for all timelinePath data  
- âœ… **"View All" Button**: Correctly placed and functional - replicates first-load experience
- âœ… **Map Visualization**: Single-day and multi-day views functional
- âœ… **Date Navigation**: All navigation methods working
- âœ… **Data Processing**: All GPS points processed correctly

### âœ… LATEST IMPROVEMENTS - September 26, 2025 (Session 2)

**UI/UX Enhancements Completed:**

1. **Fixed Duplicate Analytics Display**
   - **Issue**: Countries and states sections showed days values twice (e.g., "Croatia 1.04 days (17.3%) 1.04 days")
   - **Solution**: Removed redundant days display from text, keeping only percentage with days in badge
   - **Result**: Clean display format "Croatia (17.3%)" with "1.04 days" badge

2. **Standardized Distance Units to Miles**
   - **Issue**: Map view timeline displayed distances in kilometers/meters while rest of app used miles
   - **Solution**: Updated DayTimeline.tsx to use Earth radius in miles (3959) and display mi/ft
   - **Result**: Consistent miles/feet units throughout entire application

3. **Added Inter-Day Connecting Lines**
   - **Issue**: Multi-day map view had gaps between days, breaking travel continuity
   - **Solution**: Added dotted connecting lines between last point of day X and first point of day Y
   - **Visual**: Small frequent dashes (3,2 pattern) with reduced opacity for subtle inference indication
   - **Result**: Continuous travel routes showing complete journey across multiple days

### Outstanding:
- 106 non-critical TypeScript diagnostics in server/routes.ts (cosmetic)
