# Design Guidelines for Google Location History Analyzer

## Design Approach
**Selected Approach**: Design System (Utility-Focused)
**System**: Material Design with dark mode emphasis
**Justification**: This is a data-heavy, utility-focused application requiring efficient data visualization and analysis tools. Users need clear information hierarchy and functional interface patterns.

## Core Design Elements

### Color Palette
**Primary Colors**:
- Dark mode primary: 220 25% 15% (Deep blue-gray background)
- Dark mode surface: 220 20% 20% (Elevated surfaces)
- Accent: 200 80% 60% (Bright blue for interactive elements)

**Light Mode**:
- Light background: 210 20% 98%
- Light surface: 0 0% 100%
- Text: 220 15% 25%

### Typography
- **Primary**: Inter via Google Fonts CDN
- **Monospace**: JetBrains Mono for coordinates/technical data
- Hierarchy: text-sm, text-base, text-lg, text-xl, text-2xl

### Layout System
**Spacing Primitives**: Tailwind units of 2, 4, 6, and 8
- Consistent padding: p-4, p-6, p-8
- Margins: m-2, m-4, m-6
- Gaps: gap-4, gap-6, gap-8

### Component Library

**Navigation**: 
- Clean sidebar with collapsible sections
- Breadcrumb navigation for date/location drilling
- Tab-based switching between map and analytics views

**Data Input**:
- Drag-and-drop file upload zone with clear visual feedback
- Progress indicators for file processing
- Error states with actionable messaging

**Map Interface**:
- Full-height map container with overlay controls
- Floating date picker with smooth transitions
- Location marker clustering for dense data
- Timeline scrubber at bottom for day navigation

**Analytics Displays**:
- Card-based layout for statistics
- Clean data tables with sorting capabilities
- Subtle dividers and consistent spacing

**Forms & Controls**:
- Date range selectors with calendar popouts
- Filter dropdowns with search functionality
- Toggle switches for map layer controls

## Visual Treatment

**Interactive Elements**:
- Subtle hover states with 150ms transitions
- Focus rings for accessibility compliance
- Button states follow Material Design elevation principles

**Data Visualization**:
- Muted color palette for map backgrounds
- High contrast for data points and paths
- Consistent iconography using Material Icons CDN

**Responsive Behavior**:
- Mobile-first approach with collapsible sidebar
- Map takes priority on smaller screens
- Stacked layout for analytics cards on mobile

## Key Design Principles
1. **Data Clarity**: Information hierarchy prioritizes location data and analytics
2. **Progressive Disclosure**: Complex features revealed as needed
3. **Consistent Patterns**: Reusable components across all views
4. **Performance Focus**: Minimal animations, optimized for data-heavy operations
5. **Dark Mode Native**: Designed primarily for dark mode with light mode adaptation

No hero images or marketing elements needed - this is a utility application focused on data analysis and visualization.
