## Architecture Overview

### Frontend
- **React + TypeScript** - Type-safe component development
- **Tailwind CSS + Shadcn/ui** - Modern, accessible UI components
- **Leaflet Maps** - Interactive map visualization
- **TanStack Query** - Server state management

### Backend

- **PostgreSQL + Drizzle ORM** - Type-safe database operations
- **Multer** - Large file upload handling (up to 200MB)
- **Custom parsers** - Support for multiple Google export formats

### Key Features

#### Smart Location Processing
- **Timeline-focused parsing** - Extracts actual GPS routes from `timelinePath.point[]`
- **Coordinate deduplication** - Efficient processing of large datasets
- **Batch geocoding** - Rate-limited address resolution
- **Marine area fallback** - Handles water coordinates intelligently

#### Advanced Analytics
- **Waypoint detection** - Identifies stops, gas stations, rest areas
- **Presence analysis** - State/country time calculations
- **Travel chains** - City-to-city route mapping
- **Yearly caching** - Fast report generation
- **AI recommendations** - Personalized interesting places discovery

#### AI-Powered Features (Optional)
- **Smart pattern analysis** - AI analyzes your travel history to understand preferences
- **Personalized recommendations** - Discover businesses, landmarks, and experiences you missed
- **Location-aware suggestions** - Tailored to specific cities and regions you've visited
- **Cost-optimized AI** - Uses GPT-4o-mini for efficient token usage

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Geocoding failed" or low success rate:**
- Verify your Geoapify API key is correct
- Check you haven't exceeded the free tier limit (3,000/day)
- Clear geocoding cache: `DELETE FROM geocoding_cache;`

**"Database connection failed":**
- Ensure PostgreSQL is running
- Verify DATABASE_URL format: `postgresql://user:pass@host:port/database`
- Check database exists and user has permissions

**"File upload failed":**
- Ensure file is valid JSON from Google Takeout
- Check file size is under 200MB
- Verify file contains location data (not empty export)

**Large files taking too long:**
- Files with 100k+ points may take several minutes to process
- Processing happens in the background - check browser console for progress
- Consider splitting very large exports into smaller monthly files

### Performance Tips

- **Geocoding efficiency**: The app deduplicates coordinates before geocoding
- **Memory management**: Large files are processed in streams
- **Database optimization**: Spatial indexing enabled for fast queries
- **Caching system**: Yearly reports are cached for instant loading

## Admin Approval System

üîê **Enterprise-ready user management with admin approval workflow**

The application includes a comprehensive admin approval system for multi-user deployments. New users register but cannot access the application until approved by an administrator.

### User Registration Flow

1. **User registers** - Creates account with username/password
2. **Pending approval** - Account status set to "pending"
3. **Admin reviews** - Administrator approves or rejects the request
4. **Access granted/denied** - User can access app only after approval

### Setting Up the First Admin

**Option 1: Direct Database Setup**
```sql
-- Connect to your PostgreSQL database
UPDATE users 
SET role = 'admin', is_approved = true, approval_status = 'approved' 
WHERE username = 'your_username';
```

**Option 2: Environment Variable (Development)**
```bash
# Add to your .env file for development/testing
AUTH_BYPASS=true
```

### Admin Dashboard Features

#### User Management
- **View pending users** - See all accounts awaiting approval
- **Approve/reject accounts** - Grant or deny access with optional reason
- **User statistics** - Monitor total/pending/approved/rejected counts
- **Role management** - Assign admin privileges to trusted users

#### Admin API Endpoints

**Get Pending Users:**
```http
GET /api/admin/pending-users
Authorization: Bearer {admin_jwt_token}
```

**Approve/Reject User:**
```http
PATCH /api/admin/users/{userId}/approval
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer {admin_jwt_token}

{
  "action": "approve", // or "reject"
  "reason": "Optional rejection reason"
}
```

**Admin Statistics:**
```http
GET /api/admin/stats
Authorization: Bearer {admin_jwt_token}
```

### Admin Workflow Example

1. **New user registers**: `john_doe` creates account
2. **Admin notification**: Check `/api/admin/pending-users`
3. **Review request**: Verify user legitimacy
4. **Take action**: Approve with reason "Verified employee" or reject
5. **User notification**: John receives approval/rejection status

### Security Features

- **Role-based access control** - Only admins can approve users
- **JWT token validation** - Secure API authentication
- **Approval middleware** - Blocks unapproved users from app features
- **Audit trail** - Track who approved/rejected users and when
- **Rejection reasons** - Document why access was denied

### Multi-Admin Setup

**Promote existing users to admin:**
```sql
UPDATE users 
SET role = 'admin' 
WHERE username IN ('admin1', 'admin2');
```

**Admin privileges include:**
- Approve/reject user registrations
- View user management dashboard
- Access admin-only API endpoints
- Promote other users to admin status
