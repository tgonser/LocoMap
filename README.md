PATCH /api/admin/users/{userId}/approval
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer {admin_jwt_token}
{
  "action": "approve", // or "reject"
  "reason": "Optional rejection reason"
}

## AI-Powered Features (Optional)

### Travel Recommendations
When you provide an OpenAI API key, the application analyzes your travel patterns to generate personalized recommendations for businesses, landmarks, and unique experiences.

**API Usage:**
```http
POST /api/interesting-places
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer {jwt_token}

{
  "cities": {
    "San Francisco": 5,
    "Portland": 3
  },
  "dateRange": {
    "start": "2024-01-01",
    "end": "2024-03-31"
  }
}
```

**Cost & Performance:**
- Model: GPT-4o-mini for cost efficiency
- Typical cost: $0.01-0.05 per analysis
- Token usage: ~200-600 tokens per request
- Response time: 2-5 seconds

### Privacy & Data Usage
- Only city names and visit counts are sent to OpenAI
- No personal information, addresses, or detailed location data shared
- AI analysis happens on-demand when you request recommendations

## Contact Form Integration

### Features
- **Public contact form** - No authentication required
- **SendGrid-powered delivery** - Professional email notifications
- **HTML formatting** - Rich email content with reply-ready links
- **Form validation** - Client and server-side validation

### Setup
1. **Configure SendGrid API key** in environment variables
2. **Verify sender email** in SendGrid dashboard
3. **Test the contact form** at `/contact` route

**API Endpoint:**
```http
POST /api/contact
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "message": "Hello, I have a question..."
}
```

## Production Deployment

### Environment-Specific Configuration

**Development (Replit):**
- Neon Serverless PostgreSQL via HTTP
- Replit OAuth authentication
- In-memory session storage
- Development-optimized timeouts

**Production (Render/External):**
- Regular PostgreSQL with connection pooling
- JWT-based authentication with optional bypass
- Persistent session storage in database
- Optimized for large dataset processing

### Deployment Requirements
- **Persistent storage** for uploaded files (`UPLOADS_DIR` configuration)
- **Database migrations** handled automatically via `npm run db:push`
- **Environment variables** properly configured for production
- **First admin setup** via database command after deployment

## Data Privacy & Security

### Privacy Principles
- **User data isolation** - Each user's location data is completely separate
- **Minimal external sharing** - Only coordinates sent to geocoding APIs
- **Local processing** - All analysis happens on your infrastructure
- **User control** - Complete control over data uploads and deletions

### Security Features
- **Role-based access control** with admin approval workflow
- **JWT token authentication** for production environments
- **Session management** with PostgreSQL-backed storage
- **Input validation** on all user data with Zod schemas
- **SQL injection protection** via Drizzle ORM type safety

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Geocoding failed" or low success rate:**
- Verify Geoapify API key is correct and active
- Check you haven't exceeded free tier limit (3,000/day)
- Clear geocoding cache: `DELETE FROM geocode_cache;`

**"Database connection failed":**
- Ensure PostgreSQL is running and accessible
- Verify DATABASE_URL format and credentials
- Check database exists and user has proper permissions

**"File upload failed":**
- Ensure file is valid JSON from Google location export
- Check file size is under 200MB limit
- Verify file contains actual location data (not empty export)

**User approval not working:**
- Verify first admin was created via database command
- Check JWT token authentication is working
- Ensure admin user has proper role and approval status

**Large files taking too long:**
- Files with 100k+ points may take several minutes
- Check browser console for real-time progress updates
- Consider splitting very large exports into smaller monthly files

### Performance Tips
- **Geocoding efficiency**: System deduplicates coordinates before API calls
- **Memory management**: Large files processed in streams
- **Database optimization**: Spatial indexing and connection pooling enabled
- **Caching strategy**: Yearly reports cached for instant subsequent loading
